At Climate Compass, our mission is to deliver dependable support and relief to individuals facing the escalating threat of natural disasters. As these events become increasingly frequent and severe, we strive to equip users with vital resources that enhance safety and preparedness during critical moments. Climate Compass offers a comprehensive directory of government aid, programs, and nearby climate shelters, providing essential services to those affected by climate-related emergencies.

Climate Compass is a comprehensive web application designed with a sophisticated technology stack. The front end is built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and HTML, while the back end leverages Django. The application utilizes the Kontur.io API to collect real-time data on reported disasters worldwide. By incorporating the latest AI tools, including LLAMA 3.1 from Groq, Climate Compass provides up-to-date information on government aid and policies. Additionally, the Google Maps API is integrated to visually represent the impact of natural disasters.
